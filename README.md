How to Install
======
1. Download and extract LiSpeak (we recommend your home folder)

2. Run

    make && sudo make install

   to install

3. Run 

    cd /opt/lispeak && ./lispeak --setup

   to configure (you can use --debug to see whats happening "behind the scenes")

4. Configure a keyboard shortcut for ./hotkey - We recommend setting the hotkey command to something like "bash /home/USER/LiSpeak/hotkey" as this seems to work best. "bash" folled by the complete path.

NOTE: Ubuntu 13.10 users will need to log out and back in after setting a shortcut. 

5. That's it!

Language Support
======
Google Translate is used to automatically translate any phrases that are not pre-defined by language files. Translations are then stored locally to both increase the program's speed and provide some offline support (for mobile plugins, currently internet access is required by speech-to-text).

LiSpeak plugins are structured to easily have support for any language.
Files are named in accordance to their language. An English dictionary file is just name "en" and a Spanish dictionary file is name "es". It is that simple to add different languages.

Window Focus
=======
Plugins can add dictionaires that are applied only when a certain window is in focus.

The gedit control plugin is only in effect while gedit has focus.

Services
======
Services are plugins that run in the background and provided non-command features.

Services will also have access to the LiSpeak app indicator to add addition toggles and commands. (This is still under development)

Example:
    The Android plugin is a service, it doesn't add any commands but creates a service that uses http protocol to allow mobile phones to send it commands.
    
Multi-User Support
=======
The way plugins are installed was modified so their is now much better multi-user support. One user's plugins will no longer interfere with another user's.
